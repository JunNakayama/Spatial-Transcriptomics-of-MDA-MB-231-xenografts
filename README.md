# Spatial Transcriptomics of MDA-MB-231 xenografts
 
Welcome to the Spatial Transcriptomics of MDA-MB-231 xenografts project! 
Gene expression analysis at the single-cell scale by next generation sequencing has revealed the existence of clonal dissemination in cancer metastasis. The current spatial analysis technologies elucidate the heterogeneity of cell–cell interactions in situ; however, further analysis is needed to elucidate the nature of tumor heterogeneity. To reveal the expressional heterogeneity and cell–cell interactions in primary tumors and metastases, we performed transcriptomic analysis of microtissues dissected from a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 xenograft model by our automated tissue microdissection punching technology.
